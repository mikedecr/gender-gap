What is the gender gap? 

- two party vote among women, minus among men
- Difference in the *rates* of Democratic voting
- It's positive right now, women vote more D than men
- But we don't know if this means Democrats get *more votes*
- Gap grows from more D women, fewer R women, more R men, fewer D men
- The gender gap as a measure doesn't show us any of this

Conventional Wisdom

???

Wisdom in the press:

- comparison of rates, not total votes
- Don't know if more women or fewer men?

--

Partisanship


???

KP: Men's movement (negative relationship? Conventional wisdom in the literature)


--

Mobilization

???

Mobilization:

- Suppose a $\pm$ 1% margin world; Increasing women's turnout approaches 1% margin asymptotically
- Women's turnout has been going up: positive relationship


--

Persuasion

???

Persuasion:

- Does it work? What's the magnitude?
- Nascar moms, Security moms, white college women, but c.f. working class men


--

Necessary vs. Contingent Relationship

???

In what circumstances do the dynamics of these forces create an advantage for one party? That's the question

Just to persuade you...

  + what about EIV regression? (BRMS)
- don't support KP either

What then?

- Aggregate isn't the best way

## A Theory of Electoral Gaps

???

How do we relate the gap to the vote?

- Parties get votes from men and women
- How much of these votes are mobilized voters vs persuaded voters
- How many are men and women
- How do these things change over time to *create* a gap

Theoretical focus on mobilization and persuasion is generalizable

- race, white v nonwhite targeting
- college v non-college
- urban/rural

Behavioral vs. compositional change




---

### Party votes are mobilization + persuasion

```{r diagram-vote, include = TRUE}
include_graphics(here("slides", "apw-2018", "imgs", "diag-1-votes.png"))
```

???

- Democrats mobilized, Republicans persuaded, = Democratic votes
- Net Democratic votes = Democratic votes, minus Republican votes
- margin in raw votes

--

.center[A party wins when they **mobilize** and **persuade** more voters]



---

### *Net votes* are *net* mobilization and *net* persuasion

```{r diagram-nets, include = TRUE}
include_graphics(here("slides", "apw-2018", "imgs", "diag-2-nets.png"))
```

???

- if votes are just mobilization and persuasion, we can see which party is doing better in each mechanism
- Net Dem Mobilization: if Ds mobilize more voters than Rs, net advantage
- same for persuasion

--

.center[Who has the **mobilization advantage**? The **persuasion advantage**?]




---

### Gender gaps in mobilization and persuasion


```{r diagram-gap, include = TRUE}
include_graphics(here("slides", "apw-2018", "imgs", "diag-3-gap.png"))
```


???

- decompose the Democrats' advantage in mobilization into women and men

- If net Dem mobilization of women > men, gender gap in M

- net gender gap = add the gap in M and P


--

.center[Where does the gender gap **come from**?]

???

- is it mobilization? Persuasion?

- Does a gap form because of movement among women? or among men?


???

## Operationalizing the Model

???

- Not a statistical model per se
- a decomposition of the vote


---

### Votes are partisanship, filtered by mobilization and persuasion

--

Votes earned by party $p$ from gender $g$ in election $t$ are...

<br>

--

$$\displaystyle \mathrm{Votes}_{pgt}  =  \mathrm{Partisans}_{pgt} + f(\cdot)_{pgt}$$


???

party p, gender g, election year t

Votes aren't partisanship

- partisan baseline
- transformed by mob and per


--

<br>

$$\mathrm{Votes}_{pgt} = \mathrm{Partisans}_{pgt} + \mathrm{Mobilization}_{pgt} + \mathrm{Persuasion}_{pgt} + \mathrm{Unaffiliated}_{pgt}$$

???

What is the filtering function? 

- Adjusting the number of partisans for mobilization, persuasion, unaffiliated
- Number of partisans
- Subtract away every partisans who doesn't cast a loyal vote
- Add defections from the other party
- Add independents, nonpartisans...


Look ahead...

### Raw material for other useful concepts

$\begin{align} \mathrm{Net \, Democratic \, Votes} &= \big( \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{DW}} + \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{DM}} \big) - \big( \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{RW}} + \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{RM}} \big) \end{align}$

???

The benefit of the framework 

- rearrange terms to highlight important things
- How many votes do Democrats and Republicans get from men and women

--

or

$\begin{align}   \mathrm{Net \, Democratic \, Votes} &= \mathrm{Net \, Democratic \, Votes}_{W} + \mathrm{Net \, Democratic \, Votes}_{M} \\[6pt] &= \big( \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{DW}} - \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{RW}} \big) + \big( \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{DM}} - \mathrm{Votes}_{\mathit{RM}} \big) \end{align}$

### Net gender gap

???

How much of the Democrats' advantage comes from women vs men?

Bottom line: 

- instead of differencing the whole equation
- Difference every term, partisanship, mobilization, persuasion

### Many gender gaps

$\begin{align} \mathrm{Net \, Gender\, Gap} &= \mathrm{Partisan \, Gap} + \mathrm{Mobilization \, Gap} + \mathrm{Persuasion \, Gap} + \mathrm{Unaffiliated \, Gap} \end{align}$

<br>

--

$\begin{align} \mathrm{Net \, Gender\, Gap} &= \left( \mathrm{Net \, Dem \, Partisans}_{W} - \mathrm{Net \, Dem \, Partisans}_{M} \right) + \\[3pt] &\ \quad \left( \mathrm{Net \, Dem \, Mobilization}_{W} -  \mathrm{Net \, Dem \, Mobilization}_{M} \right) \ldots \end{align}$


???

What happened?

- we started by simply counting the votes that a party gets from partisanship, mobilization, and so on
- We can difference these equations across party to measure partisan advantages in mobilization, and so on
- We difference across gender to measure whether advantages are greater among men than women

Put it all together...

### We learn...

--

**Where** do parties gain advantage?

???

- partisanship? mobilization? persuasion?

--

**Which voters** create that advantage?

???

- is a party asymmetry coming from men or women?

--

Do gender gaps in each mechanism **help** or **hurt** Democrats?


???

- Dem advantage among women? Gap is good
- Rep advantage among men? (neg. Dem advantage) Gap is bad

### Little things

Normalization / common denominator

Estimation with multinomial outcome model


???

- How do we compare unequal survey years? 
- best common denominator: nonvoters, R vs D, men vs women, 
- Proportion of total electorate
- Mutually exclusive and exhaustive: multinomial outcome, what's the probability in each category

Partisanship minus non-mobilized = fraction of party-loyal voting

- Everyone does worse than their partisanship, but especially Democrats
- Democrats have steady increase in mobilizing, led by women
- This isn't turnout rate, it's total votes after partisanship and (non)mobilization
- could get the turnout rate by dividing panel 2 by panel 1 (MCMC)
- If the gender gap in party literature is right: before 1980, Dems ahead, but after they're behind or tied.
- Instead we see there's more going on w/ mobilization (Democrats)

???

- Two majorities
- When it comes to big change, swing voting looks like a small force (total and between genders)

Takeaways:

- Democrats lose men, which should grow the gender gap, but bad for Ds
- Dems improve mobilization over time, so making up for partisan change
- Dems also no longer hemorrhaging votes to Rs
- Unaffiliated: not much

Let's manipulate these data to look at the gender gap

- y: How does the Democratic advantage in each mech affect gender gap
- panels
  - "partial effect" or "partial impact"
- Women: (+ gap), positive data; Men (- gap), negative data

### Explaining the gap

```{r gap-partials-party, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 11}
plot_gap +
  geom_line(data = filter(gap_data_leaners, mech == "Partisanship"),
            aes(color = gender), show.legend = FALSE, size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(data = filter(gap_data_leaners, mech == "Partisanship"),
            aes(shape = gender, color = gender),
             fill = "white",
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(data = filter(gender_labels_gap, mech == "Partisanship"), 
            aes(x = x, y = y, label = lab),
            size = 3.75) +
  NULL
```


???

Women: 

- more D women than R women
- Positive Democratic advantage
- positive impact on gender gap

Men:

- past: more D men and R men
- Positive Democratic advantage
- negative impact on the gender gap
- Men become Republican, advantage shrinks, effect on the gap disappears

Put the two together, and you get...

plot_gap +
  geom_ribbon(data = filter(mc_gap, leaners == "Leaners as Unaffiliated",
                            mech == "Partisanship"), 
              aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high),
              color = NA, fill = mgray,
              alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(data = filter(gap_data_leaners, mech == "Partisanship"),

  NULL 
```

gap in partisanship emerges in the late 60s

- consistent through most of the remaining series
- slight blip in 90s, 96 regarded to be kind of outlier
- Gray bar is 95 percent "compatibility" interval

Impact on Dem vote?

- Probably bad: if driven by Men's partisanship
- strike 1 against conventional wisdom
- However, recent variation seems more from women

  NULL 
```

Mobilization:

- Republicans historically better
- Negative Dem advantage
- Men exert a positive effect on gender gap (in a way that is bad for Ds)
- Women exert a negative effect on gender gap (also bad for Ds)

Together:

- "Negative gender gap"
- Dems do better at mobilization over time, so the effect on the gender gap approaches zero
- but compares to the past, this means mobilization shrinks the gender gap but is good for Dems

Strike 2 for conventional wisdom

Persuasion

- When Rs are good at persuading D men, line above 0, 
- Bad for Democrats but it does grow the gap
- Rs persuade D women: line below zero
- Bad for Democrats, and shrinks the gap
- Rs were better at this for a while, not leaning heavily on men or women
- Drops to 0

Unaffiliated:

- limited evidence where independent men vote temporarily vote more R than D, 
- growing the gap but bad for Democrats
- inconsistent

Net gap: sum of everything else 

- Gap is mostly partisanship, bad for Democrats
- Mobilization gains among Ds have been good for Dems
- negligible or slight impact on gender gap
- Persuasion is better for Ds as well but nearly zero effect on the gap (and independents)

## Takeaways


???

- What grows the gap ≠ what grows the Democratic vote (opposite?)
- What grows the Dem vote (mob and per) doesn't affect gap as much


Partisanship

- Men more right
- initially bad
- recently good?

Mobilization and Persuasion

- Dems do better, not especially among men or women

### Categorical Outcome Model

Classify every voter along gender x party x vote (exclusive/exhaustive)

18 categories total, each with associated probability (in each year) $\pi$

What's the probability of every category in the electorate? $y_{i} \sim \mathrm{Categorical}\left( \Pi_{t[i]} \right)$

Model terms are functions of various $\pi$ elements

Calculate any quantity you want using MCMC samples
